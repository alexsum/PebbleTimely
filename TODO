TODOS:

Watchface
 - more datetime formats []
 - vibration option(s)
  - respect DND period (when exposed in SDK)
  - hourly vibrations period (e.g. 9am - 5pm?)
  New Features
    - display notice if there's a newer version available?
    - horizontal bar for seconds?
    - timezone finishing/cleanup
    - reduce calls to get_time() ?
    - Alarm
    - Charge history
      - track battery/charging events in javascript local storage, plot over time w/ history on config page
    - Accelerometer
      - Acceleromater detection for 'swapping slots'
        - slot: Weather
        - slot: 2nd Timezone clock
        - slot: Barcode(s) (if big enough to scan?)
        - slot: 2 factor authenticator
        - slot: moon phases
        - slot: geolocation (geocaching, etc.)
        - Configuration for which slots are visible under what conditions
      - Idle timer - reminder to stay active, configure inactivity period + vibe + sensitivity
        - Sleep tracking?  (extension of idle tracking, requires LOTS of work)

HTML configuration page
  - Entire page generated dynamically from metadata
  - select language @ top, localize entire page
    - change values based on language
  - embedded rather than hosted?  e.g. https://github.com/bertfreudenberg/PebbleONE/blob/master/wscript
    - not a great idea, with current IOS restrictions...
  - version clearly displayed @ top
    - display notice if there's a newer version available?
